1). *Feedback and Decisions*

We plan to incorporate dynamic HTML, as suggested. In response to the feedback on integration we have been trying to integrate the code. We now have a million questions about how to integrate the code, as we are finding it harder than expected, similar to some concerns voiced in the feedback. We also expanded the topics as suggested. If we have extra time, we could add a line on the final page about how to find your polling place or make the code more dynamic in the bills being compared. 

2). *Review Process Reflection*

Our feedback session went well verbally, but the survey had missing responses and little useful information. Much of the feedback we will be moving forward with came from our discussions with peers during class.  The conversations gave us good insight into how users would like to view our information, what types of inputs they have control of, and some of the topics they feel are important when voting.  
We stuck with our agenda fairly well, the powerpoint was useful. Next time we will use a google form and we will plan our time more efficiently, so we donâ€™t duplicate feedback.
