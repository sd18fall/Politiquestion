# Introduction to the problem we are trying to solve
We are Politiquestion. We have a survey that will help you see how well your senators are representing YOUR views. 

We are trying to solve the problem that often what politicians say doesn't line up with what they vote. We want the common voter to be able to go on our web app, and find out what their senators are actually doing, and how well it aligns with their viewpoint. 

# How we got the inspiration for this project

We knew we wanted to do something related to social justice, and as we were starting this project the midterm elections were coming up. We realized that we could make an impact in future elections be creating this web app.
