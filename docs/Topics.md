## Abortion
### Abortion is a medical procedure that results in the termination of a human pregnancy. Abortion has been a controversial issue not only in the United States, but across the world.  The topic has been typically split into two sides, Pro-Life, outlawing abortion except for the most extreme circumstances, and Pro-Choice, supporting a woman's ability to choose if and when she wants to undergo an abortion.

## Government Subsidized Health Care
### With the introduction of the Affordable Care Act, health care has become a requirement for most citizens and subsidized by the U.S. government to provide cheaper and more accessible options for everyone.  The tax penalty for not having health care and ineffectiveness of the health care system has been a main concern for critics.

## Tax cuts

## Bank Deregulation
### After the 2008 financial crisis, regulation of banks has been a high-profile subject for politicians and economists. While many have argued to have banks heavily regulated in order to prevent this from happening again, others say the banks have been over regulated in response to the crash, so much so that we are stifling economic growth.
