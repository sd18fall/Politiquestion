Politiquestion

This should be a web app that gives questions that the user can answer and find out who thier representative is and how they voted on issues. 

What it is as of now is a web app and functions that do not as of yet interact with eachother. 

Authors: Rocky, Miguel, Bailey


Running the Code:

First download all files in repository. 

The web app only requires you to run the page3.py file in the WebApp folder. 

The functions are in a file names Barebones.py. This file won't do anyting automatically when run. 
The functions that are written for pulling API are working fairly well right now.
